## FT A - Leviathan

Human civilization teeters on the edge of destruction. Will it continue to struggle in this shattered world or plunge into unending darkness? The aftermath of the Third Great Disruption remains unresolved, as vast habitable regions are eroded by Ceras. Humanity is trapped in a dual crisis of technological regression and resource depletion. To avoid total extinction, Upper Nuovartica established the Fortress in the northeastern canyon and awakened industrial experts from the old world, bringing new hope to the reconstruction of human society.

Fortress, a colossal steel behemoth overlooking desolate lands, stands as the final bastion of industrial civilization. Its sole objective is to maximize humanity's chances of survival, elevating efficiency to an uncompromising priority. Within its heavy, fortified walls, a semi-militarized community of expert engineers operates like a meticulously tuned machine, with every individual placed in the most optimal role, tirelessly working toward the revival of the golden era brought about by the Sixth Industrial Revolution.

The residents of Fortress adhere strictly to discipline, embracing efficiency and rationality as guiding principles of life, using their expertise to drive the prosperity of civilization. Their work is quantified, with every task broken into optimizable modules. Daily resource production, energy allocation, and technological development are all designed to maximize output. At the heart of this community is Logiceus, an artificial intelligence that monitors the performance of every engineer in real time, ensuring that every drop of sweat and every second of time is used to its fullest potential.


## FT B - Atlas Project

Carrying the future, shaping tomorrow! Dear Engineers, we stand at a pivotal moment in history, entrusted with a great mission. To fully restore the order and glory of human civilization, we are proud to announce that the Atlas Project will officially launch in A.R. 175! This ambitious initiative aims to establish a comprehensive water supply system, power grid, and communication network, achieving full interconnection across the Auroria continent.

Logiceus has meticulously planned every step and detail to ensure this is the most effective path to rebuilding human society. Along the major waterways of the Auroria continent, we will construct multiple integrated centers combining power generation, water supply, and computational functions. These centers will efficiently allocate hydropower resources while providing essential cooling for clean energy production and high-performance computing systems. To achieve long-term stability, some regions’ water resources will be temporarily reduced to optimize overall resource allocation.

To realize this grand vision, Fortress will consolidate and redistribute all available resources. Production and living supplies in non-critical areas will be reduced, and strategic materials from other regions will be requisitioned to free up capacity for intensive production tasks. Every resource will be allocated to its most critical use, and every engineer will play a vital role in this mission.

According to Logiceus’ precise calculations, if timelines are strictly adhered to, the Atlas Project has a 99% probability of completion within 117 years. By then, Auroria will emerge as a new world interwoven with technology and hope, where lights reignite human dreams, illuminating a new age reborn from the ashes.

For the greatest good!

## FT C - Suboptimal Solution

Sender: Internal Engineer Communication Group

Recipient: Engineer RB0416

Date: A.R. 175, Day 243

Regarding your application to preserve the Welston ancient architectural and sculptural sites, we have completed a comprehensive review and have decided not to approve your request. Below are the specific details:

Based on calculations and simulations by Logiceus, maintaining the current landscape of the Welston area would extend the Atlas Project timeline by 3 to 5 years. Over the next decade, 6.3% of regions would lack stable access to electricity, overall production efficiency would decline to an estimated 87.3%, and resource consumption would increase by 12.2%.

Welston's geographic location poses a significant obstruction to the construction of the core nodes of the Begis dam. Preserving the structures would substantially increase construction complexity and costs. While the ancient Welston sites hold notable historical and cultural value, the preservation plan has been classified as a "suboptimal option" and deemed non-viable for implementation.

We must prioritize finding the optimal solution within the constraints of limited resources and unlimited needs. The sacrifice of Welston is a necessary step to ensure the success of the Atlas Project and the achievement of its primary objectives.

Please proceed to adjust your team's construction plan to ensure the timely initiation of the demolition and dam construction work in the Welston area.

P.S. Considering your special request, we will provide full digital recording support for the Welston architectural and sculptural sites. Recording equipment will be delivered within 24 hours, and your team is expected to complete the on-site operations and digital documentation within three days.


## FT D - Job Log

A.R.175, Day 220 <br>
Snuck an extra syrup today. Logi warned me that I have "excessive carbohydrate intake" but agreed that it boosted dopamine secretion, improving my work efficiency by 3.22%. Everything's about being efficient here, even my little rule-breaking moments.

A.R.175, Day 222 <br>
Got tossed into this project with vibration sensors. Kinda curious about what they're for, but who am I gonna ask? Logi calls the shots, and I just follow.

A.R.175, Day 223 <br>
Rest day, finally. Logi booked me for 53 minutes of shuttleball at 3:26 PM. Says it's the best for my heart and lungs. Gotta keep my body in top shape, right?

A.R.175, Day 224 <br>
Working on those sensor thingies. Mid-bite at lunch, I remembered how much I dig drones. But, eh, Logiceus will probably never hook me up with drone stuff.  <br>
Oh, and the lunch today? Blah. That vitamin B flavor could wake the dead. When will I stop needing these supplemental nutrients?

A.R.175, Day 227 <br>
Stood on the Fortress wall tonight, just me and the horizon. Dreaming about the day we wrap up the Atlas. But there's this hollow feeling...

"RS0872, based on assessment, there is a 97.89% probability that your abnormal behavior is related to anxiety. Electro-signal therapy is recommended to maintain your work performance. I can schedule a session for you today, on the 237th day, at 20:38..."

"Average task completion time: 105%; Accuracy: 98%, ..."

"RS0872, your average work completion time this month is 5% slower than predicted, which is unreasonable. This is unacceptable. Your tasks have been meticulously calculated, with enough time allocated for recreation and rest..."

In Fortress, to ensure maximum productivity, Logiceus continuously monitors and evaluates every resident. Advanced algorithms and precise data analysis convert individual personality traits, skills, work performance, and contribution levels into quantifiable metrics. These numbers not only define their roles and responsibilities but also directly determine their social standing and lifestyle. Residents are meticulously classified and assigned to the most suitable projects, creating a highly optimized social structure.
