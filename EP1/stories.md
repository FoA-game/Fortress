## FT A - New Dawn

Human civilization teeters on the edge of destruction. Will it continue to struggle in this shattered world or plunge into unending darkness? The aftermath of the Third Great Disruption remains unresolved, as vast habitable regions are eroded by Ceras. Humanity is trapped in a dual crisis of technological regression and resource depletion. To avoid total extinction, Upper Nuovartica established the Fortress in the northeastern canyon and awakened industrial experts from the old world, bringing new hope to the reconstruction of human society.

Fortress, a colossal steel behemoth overlooking desolate lands, stands as the final bastion of industrial civilization. Its sole objective is to maximize humanity's chances of survival, elevating efficiency to an uncompromising priority. Within its heavy, fortified walls, a semi-militarized community of expert engineers operates like a meticulously tuned machine, with every individual placed in the most optimal role, tirelessly working toward the revival of the golden era brought about by the Sixth Industrial Revolution.

The residents of Fortress adhere strictly to discipline, embracing efficiency and rationality as guiding principles of life, using their expertise to drive the prosperity of civilization. Their work is quantified, with every task broken into optimizable modules. Daily resource production, energy allocation, and technological development are all designed to maximize output. At the heart of this community is Logiceus, an artificial intelligence that monitors the performance of every engineer in real time, ensuring that every drop of sweat and every second of time is used to its fullest potential.


## FT B - Atlas Project

Carrying the future, shaping tomorrow! The echoes of the Great Disruption still resonate, but the engineers of Fortress are set to forge the future. The year A.R. 175 marks the ambitious launch of the Atlas Project by Upper Nuovartica, a campaign not just for the comprehensive revival of civilization but a declaration for the destiny of mankind. This plan aims to construct a complete water supply system, an electrical grid, and communication stations, achieving a fully interconnected Auroria continent. The construction of the  Dam is the first chapter in this grand blueprint.

Logiceus has meticulously planned every step and detail, ensuring the optimal execution of each task. This undoubtedly represents the best path for reshaping human society. Our engineers, the builders of this era, will be dispatched to every corner of Auroria. Their footprints will span barren deserts, icy mountains, and damp marshes, laying the foundation for the future with their wisdom and sweat, connecting the scattered hopes.

Our engineers are not just implementers of technology; they are pioneers of this era. Each of their steadfast efforts, every drop of their hard-earned sweat, is a solemn promise to the prosperity of the community. According to Logiceus' precise calculations, with strict adherence to the schedule, there is a 98.3761% confidence level that the Atlas Project will reach completion in 117 years. By then, Auroria will emerge as a new world interwoven with technology and hope, where lights reignite human dreams, illuminating a new age reborn from the ashes.


## FT C - Leviathan

Logiceus, the world's second-largest artificial intelligence, is not only the embodiment of reason but also the core of the Fortress's operations. Its existence heralds an era dominated by calm, precise logic.

Logiceus permeates every corner of Fortress, every machine, every engineer's life. Day after day, it receives directives from Upper Nuovartica, managing complex engineering projects and assigning precise daily tasks to each resident. Every morning, as the first rays of sunlight pierce through the heavy clouds, the voice of Logiceus echoes in the engineers' dormitories. It is calm and merciless, conveying the day's work schedule and commands. There is no doubt, no contradiction, only brief and efficient instructions. Under the guidance of Logiceus, engineers function optimally like precisely programmed components, executing each calculated step without hesitation.

In the world of Logiceus, everything is for efficiency, for rationality, for the completion of the greatest endeavors. But in this highly programmed life, do the engineers begin to question? Do they still possess their own will, or have they merely become part of this immense machine?


## FT D - Job Log

A.R.175, Day 220 <br>
Snuck an extra syrup today. Logi warned me that I have "excessive carbohydrate intake" but agreed that it boosted dopamine secretion, improving my work efficiency by 3.22%. Everything's about being efficient here, even my little rule-breaking moments.

A.R.175, Day 222 <br>
Got tossed into this project with vibration sensors. Kinda curious about what they're for, but who am I gonna ask? Logi calls the shots, and I just follow.

A.R.175, Day 223 <br>
Rest day, finally. Logi booked me for 53 minutes of shuttleball at 3:26 PM. Says it's the best for my heart and lungs. Gotta keep my body in top shape, right?

A.R.175, Day 224 <br>
Working on those sensor thingies. Mid-bite at lunch, I remembered how much I dig drones. But, eh, Logiceus will probably never hook me up with drone stuff.  <br>
Oh, and the lunch today? Blah. That vitamin B flavor could wake the dead. When will I stop needing these supplemental nutrients?

A.R.175, Day 227 <br>
Stood on the Fortress wall tonight, just me and the horizon. Dreaming about the day we wrap up the Atlas. But there's this hollow feeling...


## FT E - Quantified Persona

"Attention: 47 points; Comprehension: 91 points; Memory: 85 points; Self-control: 69 points, ..."

"RS0872, based on assessment, there is a 97.89% probability that your abnormal behavior is related to anxiety. Electro-signal therapy is recommended to maintain your work performance. I can schedule a session for you today, on the 237th day, at 20:38..."

"Average task completion time: 105%; Accuracy: 98%, ..."

"RS0872, your average work completion time this month is 5% slower than predicted, which is unreasonable. This is unacceptable. Your tasks have been meticulously calculated, with enough time allocated for recreation and rest..."

In Fortress, to ensure maximum productivity, Logiceus continuously monitors and evaluates every resident. Advanced algorithms and precise data analysis convert individual personality traits, skills, work performance, and contribution levels into quantifiable metrics. These numbers not only define their roles and responsibilities but also directly determine their social standing and lifestyle. Residents are meticulously classified and assigned to the most suitable projects, creating a highly optimized social structure.
